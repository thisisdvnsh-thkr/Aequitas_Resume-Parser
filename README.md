# Resume Parsing WebApp
 

## Introduction
This project creates a web application designed to evaluate the compatibility of a resume with a job descripti# Aequitas - AI-Powered Resume Screening & Fairness Auditor

## Introduction
Aequitas is an AI-driven web application designed to evaluate the alignment between a candidate's resume and a specific job description. Developed as a minor project for the 7th-semester B.Tech curriculum in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, the system utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and vector space modeling to provide a quantifiable compatibility score and detailed skill-gap analysis.

You can access the live application here:  
**[PASTE_YOUR_STREAMLIT_URL_HERE]**

## Features
- **Dual-Format Support:** Seamlessly handles both PDF and DOCX files for Job Descriptions and Resumes.
- **Automated Skill Extraction:** Uses specialized NLP parsing to identify relevant technical and soft skills.
- **Similarity Scoring:** Employs mathematical vectorization to compute a compatibility percentage.
- **Skill-Gap Analytics:** Visually differentiates between matching competencies and missing requirements.
- **Aequitas Auditor Interface:** A custom-styled UI designed for professional fairness auditing.

## Technical Details
1. **Text Extraction:**
   - PDF text extraction is performed using `pdfminer.six`.
   - DOCX text extraction is performed using `docx2txt`.

2. **Skill Extraction:**
   - Relevant skills are identified from the text using a predefined skill set and regular expression matching.

3. **Similarity Calculation:**
   - Utilizes `CountVectorizer` to transform raw text into numerical feature vectors.
   - Implements **Cosine Similarity** from `sklearn` to compute the compatibility score between the two documents.

4. **Streamlit WebApp:**
   - Provides an interactive, dark-themed interface for real-time analysis and result visualization.

## Technical Details
1. Text Extraction:

- PDF text extraction is performed using `pdfminer`.
- DOCX text extraction is done using `docx2txt`.
2. Skill Extraction:

- Skills are matched against a predefined list using regular expressions.
3. Similarity Calculation:

- Utilizes `CountVectorizer` and `cosine_similarity` from `sklearn` to compute the compatibility score.
4. Streamlit WebApp:

- Provides an interactive interface for users to upload files and view results.
- Displays the compatibility score and skill comparison using custom styling.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```python
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```
2. Install the required packages:

```python
pip install streamlit docx2txt pdfminer.six scikit-learn
```
3. Run the Streamlit app:

```python
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage
1. Upload the job description and resume files in PDF or DOCX format.
2. Click the "Calculate" button to compute the compatibility score and view the results.
3. Review the matching and missing skills to assess how well your resume aligns with the job description.
   
## Conclusion
The Resume Parsing WebApp provides an intuitive platform for comparing resumes with job descriptions, helping users improve their job application materials. By analyzing text and extracting key skills, it aids in identifying areas of strength and gaps, enhancing overall job application effectiveness.

For recruiters, this tool is invaluable as it streamlines the candidate screening process by quickly identifying how well a resume matches job requirements.
