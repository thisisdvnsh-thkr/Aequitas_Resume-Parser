An intelligent and fair AI system for 
resume screening — analyses resumes against 
job descriptions using NLP to provide 
match scores and skill gap analysis.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional resume screening relies on 
keyword matching which introduces bias 
based on phrasing, gender and background 
rather than actual skills and competency.

Aequitas solves this by using **Cosine 
Similarity** and **NLP techniques** to 
calculate match percentage purely based 
on technical skills and content — 
removing human and keyword bias.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📄 **Multi-Format Support** — Accepts 
  PDF and DOCX files for both resumes 
  and job descriptions
- 🔍 **Intelligent Parsing** — Extracts 
  and cleans text using Regex and 
  Tokenization
- 📊 **Compatibility Score** — Calculates 
  match percentage (0-100%) using 
  vector similarity
- ✅ **Matched Skills** — Shows skills 
  present in both resume and JD
- ❌ **Missing Skills** — Highlights 
  critical skills absent from resume
- ⚖️ **Bias Reduction** — Focuses purely 
  on technical skills and content

                              ▼
                    Match Score (0-100%)
                    + Skill Gap Analysis
```

## 📊 Output

- **Match Score** — Percentage compatibility 
  between resume and job description
- **Matched Skills** — Common technical 
  keywords found in both
- **Missing Skills** — Skills in JD 
  not found in resume
- **Bias-free analysis** — No demographic 
  or formatting bias
